NOTE
------------------


Our team worked on the same code together, each of us
added our own code to the same files. Because the
notification that we were supposed to provide unique
work came only a day before the submission date,
we were unable to redo this assignment as completely
our own code therefore we have submitted the same code
we all worked on.
