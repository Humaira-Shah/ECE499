NOTES ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES:
THE ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED SUCH THAT A C PROGRAM GETS USER INPUT IN THE FORM OF ARROW KEYS OR THE 'q' KEY
THE C PROGRAM THEN PUTS A VALUE SIGNALING WHAT USER INPUT HAS BEEN RECEIVED ONTO A CHANNEL CALLED controller-ref-chan
IF THE USER INPUT WAS A VALID INPUT. ANY INPUT BESIDES THE ARROW KEYS AND THE 'q' KEY ARE IGNORED
THE PYTHON PROGRAM THEN GETS ANY NEW INPUT ON THE CHANNEL AND USES THE INPUT TO MOVE THE ROBOT ACTUATORS APPROPRIATELY
OR IF THE 'q' KEY IS QUIT, THE PYTHON PROGRAM RECOGNIZES THIS AND QUITS. THE C PROGRAM QUITS WHEN 'q' IS PRESSED AS WELL


HOW TO RUN:
1. RUN GAZEBO
2. MAKE THE USED CHANNEL USING: ach mk controller-ref-chan
3. MAKE THE C-FILES USING: make
4. RUN THE PYTHON PROCESS USING: python hw3.py
5. RUN THE C PROCESS USING: ./controller-c-put
6. ENTER ARROW KEYS or 'q' APPROPRIATELY INTO THE C PROCESS's TERMINAL
7. WHEN YOU'VE QUITTED THE PROCESSES REMOVE CHANNEL USING: ach rm controller-ref-chan
