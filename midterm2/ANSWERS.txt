question 3c answer
	
	For set1
		In terminal type "python q3cSet1.py"
		computational code in question3c.py
		x = 0.763754526795
		y = 0.417240999618

	Did not have time to do set 2

question 3e answer
	In terminal type "octave question3e.m"
	I did this question with set1 instead because I ran out of time to plug in set2
	but I know the answer is correct given the input from set1

	1) the resulting transformation matrix

		T =
	
		   0.62161  -0.78333   0.00000   0.76375
		   0.78333   0.62161   0.00000   0.41724
		   0.00000   0.00000   1.00000   0.00000
		   0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   1.00000

	2) the x,y location of the end effector

		(x,y) = (0.76375 , 0.41724)

question 4f answer
	*In terminal type "python question4f.py"
	*Press enter after each set result angles are printed to move to next set computation
	*I was unable to get answers for this, the loop went on for what felt like forever with
	 set 1 and I still couldn't get an answer. Sample output is shown in IKISSUES.txt
	*Commented code for Jacobian IK computation I did is in JIK2DOF.py
